The granite monolith, also known as \"El Cap\", is one of the most famous and impressive rock formations in the world.\n\nFor this hike into the Yosemite wilderness, you should not only be in decent shape but also bring sturdy shoes, a GPS device, sufficient provisions, and possibly a water filter and trekking poles.

Total mileage from the start/finish of the trail was closer to 16 miles and 4900\u2019 elevation gain.  Our hike was 16.5 because we added a stop at Yosemite Falls. \\nAlso, to get to the edge of El Capitan it is a decent of +/- 650 ft and the climb back up to the peak after a lunch was something to rethink.  \\n\\nThe views from the edge of El Capitan were average, perhaps even a little disappointing (relative to Yosemite standards) - we did a side trip to Yosemite Falls this trip but did not do Eagle Point which many have said does have amazing views - have to do this next time. \\n\\nAs others have mentioned, definitely a more advanced hike - the most difficult portion was the first 3.2 miles and the last 3.2 miles up and down from the Yosemite Falls trail.  Slushy snow makes you work a little harder but a really good day.  \\n\\n\\n \",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Greg Mellor\",\"url\":\"/members/greg-mellor-1\"}}",

If you want to camp there, there is one small spot at the top, and a couple that are down a little ways. However, finding a good area can be pretty tricky - not many flat areas and many spots have ant hills. It\u2019s definitely worth the hassle, as you can get a really good sunset and sunrise. If you don\u2019t camp here, the next best spot is probably after the Eagle Peak turnout in the direction of Upper Falls.\\n\\nTons of water sources along the way, though good portion of them will be dry later this year. The best is Cascade Creek - tons of swimming spots and many pools where you can catch trout if you want to fish.\\n\\nUpper Falls is still flowing strong right now, but will most likely be much slower in about a month. I think the best views weren\u2019t at the very top, but at some of the viewpoints on the way down.\\n\\nFor parking, we left one car at Big Oak Flat and another at Yosemite Village. It\u2019ll add a little bit extra at the end to get to Yosemite Village, but the wilderness station said you cannot park at the Upper Falls lot overnight.\\n\\nAnother note - if you\u2019re into birds, I heard a Northern Pygmy Owl at Eagle Peak early in the morning. The call was very clear and it went on for a long time.

Other than that I had the trail, El Cap, Eagle Peak, North Dome, Indian Arch/Rock all to myself. The views from Indian Arch/Rock are awesome and SUPER RARE as they are too isolated for day hikers. I was crossing untouched snow on the trail from two days prior.\\n\\nThis was an incredible adventure. I carried a 45 pound pack. The climb to elevation was brutal (4mi-7mi). The decent back into the valley is 2,600ft of switchbacks (26mi-28mi)... Ouch! It was some suffering on the last stretch to finish. This trail is not for the light hearted. YOU WILL BE CHALLENGED!\\n\\nWARNING - If you are doing this trail late-season, make sure you are carrying plenty of water, you are monitoring the weather constantly, and you are prepared for rapid weather shifts. I was in shorts and T-shirt on the sunny trails and a ZERO degree sleeping bag at night.\\n\\nSNOW - I caught a snow storm overnight on El Capitan and woke up to 2 inches of fresh snow. Most of it melted off as the sun came up and there was only snow on the trail through some of the shaded forest sections.\\n\\nFOG & SUB-FREEZING TEMPS  - After a late start packing up post snow at El Capitan, I got to North Dome post sundet and super dense white out fog rolled in. I had to finish the last 1 mile looking at the GPS map on my phone because I could barely see the end of my trekking pole. I found camp in a wooded section by looking at the satellite images on the map. I was able to set up camp in the dark and made it through the 27degF COLD TEMP  night. KNARLY Experience!!! But I woke up straight across from Half Dome and view was majestic! \\n\\nBEAR - At Snow Creek, I came to a mama bear and her 2-3 cubs standing 25 yards in front of me on the trail. She stared at me for a moment then walked awake. 2 hours later, when I got down to the valley floor near Mirror Lake a couple told me they just saw a bear on the path in front of them.\\n\\nCAMP:\\nMile 10 - El Capitan\\nMile 20 - North Dome\\n\\nI backpacked the trail solo the first weekend in November which means water was a rare find. There were a few running streams heading up to Cascade Creek, then is was pretty much dry from Cascade to Yosemite Creek (12mi). There was water at Lehamite and Snow Creek, but I had cooler temps which meant plenty of water  to make it back to the valley.\\n\\nWATER:\\nStart - Big Oak (3L)\\nMile 4 - Cascade Creek (Had  3.5L, Filled to 4L)\\nMile 16 - Yosemite Creek (Had 0.5L, Filled to 4L)\\nMile 18.5 - Lehamite Creek (Skipped)\\nMile 27 - Snow Creek (Skipped)\\nFinish - Had 1.0 L\\n\\nCurrent Trail Conditions & Updates:\\nhttps://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wildcond.htm\\n\\nI this hope it helps!\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Darnell Kemp\",\"url\":\"/members/darnell-kemp\"}}",

Took a couple of steps out in 2 spots before deciding to down climb off the slabs and thrash through the bush and trees.\n\nPretty easy to find on the way back.

    "description": "This trail takes you on the climber's approach trail to the base of Cathedral Peak. If you are looking for a challenge, continue along up the climber's descent route to the summit of Cathedral Peak. There are gorgeous views from the summit. The majority of the trail is a steady but not-too-steep uphill until near the top of the peak. At that point some scrambling and climbing are necessary to reach the summit where the view is the best.",

From there I headed back to Happy Isles via JMT.  \\nWhile the mileage and elevation gain were not oppressive, I found two factors that made this 4-day trek more difficult:\\n1. The trails generally went up or down.  Very few flat stretches it seemed.\\n2. The trails were well-engineered with stone steps or had numerous stones embedded in the ground to reduce erosion and also serve as tripping hazards.
